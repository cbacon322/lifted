A running list of things I want to complete. These should not be attempted until I give explicit instructions to do so.

-------------------------------------------------------------

- When finish workout is clicked, the empty exercises prompt lists every skipped exercise in a comma delimited, its too wordy and hard to read. can we have each exercise be on a new line for easier reading

- when i complete a workout, it says error failed to load workout data and goes back to the active workout. typerror cannot read property prototype of undefined. But hitting cancel lets me go back to the workouts page

- empty workout button on Workouts page

- change the template structure to include groups. That way in the details i can see that this part is the warmup, this is the main workout (not sure what to name this group) and another group could be cardio. 

- in edit workout and in the active workout, i should be able to hold an exercise and then drag it to a different spot in the workout in order to change the order of the lifts

- i also want a group that is like "postponed" or something for exercises that i want to eventually incorporate into the lift but not today. So that could be like a dropdown at the bottom of every workout details/active workout that can be moved 

- is there a database for exercises? i shouldnt be able to add an exercise that already exists and i should be able to add exercises to a template from the edit tempalte button and also in the active workout screen that i can then afterwards choose whether to apply to the template
