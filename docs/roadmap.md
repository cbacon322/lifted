A running list of things I want to complete. These should not be attempted until I give explicit instructions to do so.

-------------------------------------------------------------

- empty workout button on Workouts screen

- change the template structure to include groups. That way in the details i can see that this part is the warmup, this is the main workout (not sure what to name this group) and another group could be cardio. They should be differentiated in the active workout screen somehow, maybe a small header above the exercise card of the first exercise in that group. So something like:

Warmup
---
Wall Lat Press
1x2

Lat Release
2x2

I would also like if the group was a toggle list, so the warmup would fold into the warmup header if i clicked on the header toggle

- in edit workout and in the active workout, i should be able to hold an exercise and then drag it to a different spot in the workout in order to change the order of the lifts

- i also want a group that is like "postponed" or something for exercises that i want to eventually incorporate into the lift but not today. So that could be like a dropdown at the bottom of every workout details/active workout that can be moved 

- every imported template will create an exercise for each exercise in the template. since the templates are ususally hand written, there may be an overlap of the same exercise just with different names, is there a way to maybe check to see if the same exercise already exists in the exercise database? If so, maybe then ask the user upon import if they'd like to merge these exercise objects into one and whihc name to keep? Idk how you'd check to see if they are the same though.

- library screens have different placements empty messages... "No archived workouts" and "No archived exercises" are lower down on their screens than the "No exercises yet" text. I looked at the code, they dont seem to have specific padding set anywhere, not sure what to do to make sure they're congruently placed on the screen.
